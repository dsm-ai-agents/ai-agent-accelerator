# Lead Qualification via Telegram Bot (BANT Framework)

This document explains how to set up a **Telegram Bot for lead qualification** using **BANT criteria** (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline).  
It includes both the **framework for development** and the **ready-to-use prompt**.

---

## üìå Why BANT?
BANT is a classic sales qualification framework:
- **B**udget ‚Üí Do they have money to buy?  
- **A**uthority ‚Üí Are they the decision-maker?  
- **N**eed ‚Üí Do they need your solution?  
- **T**imeline ‚Üí When will they buy?  

Using this in a **Telegram Bot workflow** helps automate lead collection, qualification, and scoring.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Framework

### 1. **Trigger**
- Use **Telegram Trigger node** in n8n to capture incoming messages.  
- Extract:
  - `message.text`  
  - `chat.id`  
  - `from.first_name`

### 2. **Memory Tracking**
- Store lead information across multiple messages:
  - Name (from Telegram profile or first user input)  
  - Email  
  - Budget  
  - Timeline  
  - Authority  

### 3. **Conversation Flow**
- Bot should ask **one missing piece of info at a time**.  
- Prioritized sequence: **Name ‚Üí Email ‚Üí Budget ‚Üí Timeline ‚Üí Authority**.  
- Once all details are collected ‚Üí Send **thank you message** and mark lead as qualified.  

### 4. **Answer Normalization**
- Convert multiple-choice answers (A/B/C/D) into full-text values.  
- Example:  
  - Input: `A` ‚Üí Output: `"Under $1,000/month"`

### 5. **Lead Scoring**
- Add logic to score based on urgency & authority:
  - High urgency + decision authority = **HOT LEAD**  
  - Medium urgency + partial authority = **WARM LEAD**  
  - Low urgency + no authority = **COLD LEAD**  

### 6. **Final Output**
- Return structured JSON for logging, CRM integration, or further automation.
